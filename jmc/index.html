<p>jmc is a fast, no-nonsense media manager for macOS. It has an elegant, streamlined interface that harkens back to early versions of iTunes. jmc aims to give you the power and functionality associated with hackable media managers like foobar2000 with the elegance and simplicity of a well-designed platform-native macOS application.</p>

<p>jmc:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses less memory and CPU than iTunes while performing better with libraries both small and large (50,000+ tracks).</li>
<li>Lets you look at your album art again.</li>
<li>Plays your albums in the correct order, Every Time.™</li>
<li>Lets you share your music over a local area network.</li>
<li>Has an elegant, simple and powerful interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>jmc is written completely in Swift, is completely open-source, and runs on OS X (macOS) 10.10 and above.</p>

<h1 id="features">Features</h1>

<p>jmc looks a lot like iTunes, while fixing many frustrating and unintuitive aspects of the iTunes interface. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>jmc doesn&rsquo;t change your focus in the songs view when you skip a song.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re listening to a playlist and queue up a track, you won&rsquo;t hear it twice.</li>
<li>Ordering a track to play while there are manually queued tracks doesn&rsquo;t result in <a href="https://i.imgur.com/oQb22Fk.png">this dumb dialog box</a>. jmc just plays the track.</li>
<li>Deterministic behavior upon adding tracks to the library. jmc doesn&rsquo;t automatically play songs that you add to the library unless you tell it to.</li>
<li>jmc remembers your selection, scroll point, and sort behavior in all playlist views, so you can more easily manage your playlists.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, jmc&rsquo;s interface should simply work the way you want it to.</p>

<h3 id="advanced-search">Advanced Search</h3>

<p>jmc does away with the Column Browser in iTunes, in favor of a more powerful and flexible advanced search:</p>

<p>Using advanced search, users can filter their library by arbitrary criteria and create smart playlists.</p>

<h3 id="shared-libraries">Shared Libraries</h3>

<p>jmc can connect to jmc clients nearby, displaying them in the source list. Clients can connect to each other using either Ethernet, infrastructure Wi-Fi, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi for clients in close physical proximity on different networks. Clients can stream music from each other, or drag and drop.</p>

<p>For a more complete list of current and upcoming features, take a look at the <a href="https://jcm93.github.io/jmc/roadmap">roadmap</a>.</p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<p>You can either compile jmc from source manually or download the latest stable artifact <a href="https://github.com/jcm93/jmc/">here</a>. In the future, binaries for jmc will likely be distributed through the App Store. In the meantime, please consider <a href="https://jcm93.github.io/money/">buying me some coffee or food</a>!</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>You can choose to allow jmc to organize your library by moving or copying added files, or have it perform no organization at all.</p>

<p>To import an existing iTunes library, use the “Import iTunes Library” action in the File menu, and point the importer at your iTunes Library.xml file.</p>

<p>When adding media, jmc can rename your files to follow the “${disc number}-${track number} ${track name}.${extension}” convention. Currently, jmc will never modify the content of files.</p>
